# Backends → Go Migration — Status & Next Steps

This document summarizes the status of the T047–T057 migration (migrating selected backend services to Go), actions taken, validation performed, and next steps.

## Summary

- Scope: Migrate the following services to Go (scaffold + parity validation): chat, contacts, document-updater, notifications, real-time, clsi, docstore, filestore, history-v1, project-history, web.
- Status: Initial migration completed (scaffolding, health endpoints, in-memory stores, unit tests and CI workflows added). Merge commit was applied to `main` after validation in an isolated worktree.
- Branch: `migrate/backends-to-go` contains the scaffolding and CI workflows.

## Validation performed

- `go test ./...` executed per-service and passed for the added unit tests.
- `go vet` run per-service (no findings).
- A merge of `migrate/backends-to-go` → `main` was validated in a worktree and pushed when local validation passed.
- Contract & benchmark jobs remain to be ported and tightened per-service (to be scheduled).</n

## Remaining work / Priorities

- Port core business logic and contract tests for each service (next priority: `web` and `real-time`).
- Add contract/benchmark tests (SLO gating) per the feature spec (key lookup p95 ≤ 50ms, introspect p95 ≤ 100ms).
- Add parity/contract CI jobs for each service where applicable.
- Remove or deprecate Java artifacts once parity is confirmed by CI for the Go binaries.

## Monitoring & Automation

- A monitor script runs on schedule (`.github/workflows/monitor-actions.yml`) to detect CI failures and file issues.
- Current monitor mode: issue-only (it files issues and opens PRs for small fixes, but does not rerun workflows because the repo token does not have Actions write scope).

## How to help / Requests

- Add a repository secret `AUTO_MERGE_TOKEN` with Actions/Workflows (or provide a fine-grained PAT with Workflows write) if you want the monitor to also rerun workflows automatically.
- Prioritize which service to port next (I can proceed with the `web` service porting next if you authorize it).
