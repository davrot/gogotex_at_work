## Summary

This PR (branch: `pr/enable-parity-strict`) contains the following changes:

- Replaced hard-coded examples that used `127.0.0.1:3900` with `localhost:3900` in integration and contract scripts.
- Added `scripts/ci/check_no_127.sh` — a fast regression check that fails CI when `127.0.0.1:3900` appears anywhere in the repo.
- Added a CI job `no_127_3900_check` to `ci/contract/gitlab-ci-contract.yml` to run the above check early in the pipeline.
- Confirmed that `scripts/contract/compare_ssh_parity.sh` and the Go shim integration test run successfully against a shim listening on `localhost:3900`.

## Why

Using `127.0.0.1:3900` in examples or scripts is against our design doc because it can be ambiguous inside containers and breaks test/CI networking expectations. This change ensures a consistent and safer default and prevents accidental reintroduction with a CI check.

## How to validate locally

1. Run the integration test (requires Go installed or a running shim at :3900):
   - `bash services/git-bridge/cmd/webprofile-api/integration_test.sh`

2. Run the parity comparison from the repo root:
   - `bash scripts/contract/compare_ssh_parity.sh http://develop-web-1:3000 http://localhost:3900 ci-compare-user`

3. Run the host-check regression test locally:
   - `bash scripts/ci/check_no_127.sh` (should exit 0)

## Notes for reviewers

- I could not create the GitHub PR from the runner because `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`gh` was not available in this environment; the branch is pushed to `origin/pr/enable-parity-strict`.
- Once PR is created, please ensure the CI contract jobs run (the parity job is allowed to fail until `ci/PARITY_STRICT` is set to `true`).

## Next steps after merge

- Optionally flip `ci/PARITY_STRICT` to `true` on default branch to enforce parity checks as blocking once parity is stable.
- Consider adding the host-check script to other pipelines (e.g., PR lint job) to catch issues earlier.
